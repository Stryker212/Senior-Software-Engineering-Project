  <title>Scarps</title>
  <abstract>This feature class represents lines of the uppermost extent of landslide head scarp and any internal scarps within the body of the landslide.

This data set is a statewide inventory of mapped landslide scarp lines, compiled from numerous studies. This inventory is not regulatory, and revisions can happen when new information regarding landslides is found or when future (new) landslides occur. The original studies vary widely in scale, scope and focus which is reflected in the wide range of accuracy, detail, and completeness with which landslides are mapped. To determine the source of each landslide scarp line, refer to the REF_ID_COD attribute field. The landslide inventory is intended to provide users with basic information regarding landslides. The geologic, terrain, and climatic conditions that led to landslides in the past may provide clues to the locations and conditions of future landslides, and it is intended that this data will provide useful information to develop regional landslide susceptibility maps, to guide site-specific investigations for future developments, and to assist in regional planning and mitigation of existing landslides.
